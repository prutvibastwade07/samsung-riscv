**C and RISC-V Based Labs**

This repository demonstrates the processes involved in compiling C programs and generating assembly code using both a standard GCC compiler and a RISC-V GCC compiler. It includes comprehensive steps and explanations to guide users through each stage of the compilation and debugging workflow.

**C Language-Based Lab**

*Steps to Compile a .c File on Your Machine:*

1. Open the bash terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your file.
2. Use the following command to create and edit a new .c file:
   ```sh
   gedit sum_1ton.c
![sum1ton_code_snippet](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04232a53-ca09-4015-85fb-3a441fc0b7dd)
**Steps to Compile a .c File :**
 ```sh
 gcc sum_1ton.c
 ./a.out
```
**Compilation and execution complete.**

**RISC-V Based Lab**

### Steps to Compile Using RISC-V GCC Compiler:
1. Ensure the RISC-V GCC compiler is installed and accessible on your system.
2. Verify the .c file contents using the cat command:
```sh
cat sum_1ton.c
```

4. Compile the C program for RISC-V architecture using:
 ```sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum_1ton.o sum_1ton.c
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
```
![O1 and Ofast](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/463e27c5-465e-4dd3-ae1c-899aae08c371)


5. Disassemble the object file to view its assembly code using:
 ```sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum_1ton.o
```
6. Use /main in the terminal to locate the main function in the assembly output.

# Understanding RISC-V and Its Instruction Formats

## What is RISC-V?
RISC-V is an open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) that enables developers to design processors tailored to specific applications. Based on Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) principles, RISC-V represents the fifth generation of processors built on this concept. Its open and free nature means developers can utilize RISC-V without purchasing licenses, making it a compelling alternative to proprietary processor technologies.

## Instruction Formats in RISC-V
The instruction format of a processor defines how machine language instructions are structured for execution. These instructions are composed of binary data (0s and 1s), each segment providing details about data location and operations to be performed. In RISC-V, there are six primary instruction formats:

1. **R-format**
2. **I-format**
3. **S-format**
4. **B-format**
5. **U-format**
6. **J-format**

### 1. R-type Instruction
R-type (Register-type) instructions operate on registers rather than memory locations. These are used for arithmetic and logical operations. Each instruction is 32 bits and divided into six fields:

#### Structure:

| Field Name | Size  | Description                            |
|------------|-------|----------------------------------------|
| Opcode     | 7 bits| Determines the instruction type        |
| rd         | 5 bits| Destination register                  |
| func3      | 3 bits| Specifies the type of operation       |
| rs1        | 5 bits| First source register                 |
| rs2        | 5 bits| Second source register                |
| func7      | 7 bits| Additional operation specification    |

#### Example: ADD r9, r2, r5
- **Operation:** Adds values in registers r2 and r5, storing the result in r9.
- **Field Breakdown:**

  - Opcode: `0110011`
  - rd (Destination): `r9` -> `01001`
  - rs1 (Source 1): `r2` -> `00010`
  - rs2 (Source 2): `r5` -> `00101`
  - func3: `000`
  - func7: `0000000`
- **32-bit Instruction:** `0000000_00101_00010_000_01001_0110011`


#### Example: XOR r10, r1, r4
- **Operation:** XOR operation between r1 and r4, result in r10.
- **Field Breakdown:**

  - Opcode: `0110011`
  - rd (Destination): `r10` -> `01010`
  - rs1 (Source 1): `r1` -> `00001`
  - rs2 (Source 2): `r4` -> `00100`
  - func3: `100`
  - func7: `0000000`
- **32-bit Instruction:** `0000000_00100_00001_100_01010_0110011`


#### Example: SLT r11, r2, r4
- **Operation:** Sets r11 to 1 if r2 < r4; otherwise, sets r11 to 0.
- **Field Breakdown:**

  - Opcode: `0110011`
  - rd (Destination): `r11` -> `01011`
  - rs1 (Source 1): `r2` -> `00010`
  - rs2 (Source 2): `r4` -> `00100`
  - func3: `010`
  - func7: `0000000`
- **32-bit Instruction:** `0000000_00100_00010_010_01011_0110011`

| rd         | 5 bits| Destination register                  |
| func3      | 3 bits| Specifies the type of operation       |
| rs1        | 5 bits| Source register                       |
| imm[11:0]  | 12 bits| Immediate value                      |

#### Example: ADDI r12, r4, 5
- **Operation:** Adds immediate value 5 to the value in r4 and stores it in r12.
- **Field Breakdown:**
  - Opcode: `0010011`
  - rd (Destination): `r12` -> `01100`
  - rs1 (Source): `r4` -> `00100`
  - imm[11:0] (Immediate): `000000000101`
  - func3: `000`
- **32-bit Instruction:** `000000000101_00100_000_01100_0010011`
